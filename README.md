# object_detection_ssd_method
This object detection project only includes opencv library. In object detection there are many methods for detection and in here "Single shot detection" method is used.
We are using mobilenet ssd method on coco dataset. COCO dataset includes name of all those classes which will be detected.
The Object Detection opencv method we will use is a sweet balance between speed and accuracy. Unlike many other object detection methods, we will be able to run this in real time with a good amount of accuracy.
